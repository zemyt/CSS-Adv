                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                            100% recommend! ”</p>
